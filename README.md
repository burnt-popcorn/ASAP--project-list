## Project Title : List of the Worst Elevator Music Tracks

Project Overview: This project will allow users to log in, view a personalized list of the worst (or funniest) elevator music tracks ever made, and rate them. The list will vary based on user preferences (e.g., their favorite genres of bad music), and users will be able to submit their own “elevator music” tracks for others to rate. This project could also involve users voting on which track they think is the worst.

## Key Features:

User Authentication: Users can log in and create an account to keep track of their ratings and submitted tracks.
Personalized Lists: Users will see a list of elevator music tracks that are tailored to their tastes (i.e., worst rated by other users).
Voting System: Users can upvote or downvote tracks, influencing the list order.
Track Submission: Users can submit their own elevator music tracks (by providing a track URL or title), which will be added to the list for others to vote on.
Track Ratings: Allow users to rate each track based on its "elevator music" level, with average ratings displayed.
Database Management: Store user data, track information, and ratings in the database.
Responsive Frontend: A basic React app where users can see the list of tracks, vote on them, and submit new tracks.

## Tech stack:

Frontend: React, Vite, HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS or simple styling)
Backend: Express, Node.js
Database: MongoDB (using Mongoose for schema)
Authentication: Session-based authentication or Firebase Auth (optional)
API: RESTful API for user management and track interaction (CRUD operations)
Deployment: Vercel (Frontend) and Heroku or DigitalOcean (Backend)

## Why this project:

This project offers an exciting blend of fun and technical challenges. It allows me to implement basic web functionalities like creating and managing user accounts, submitting content, voting systems, and displaying dynamic content based on user interaction. It's perfect for demonstrating proof of concepts, including API design, data management, frontend integration, and authentication. I’ll also get practical experience with both React for the frontend and Express/MongoDB for the backend.
